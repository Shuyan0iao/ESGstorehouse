# Megatrends and Drivers Influencing Environmental Change

## 1. Challenges of Carbon Emission Benchmarks
- High carbon emissions don’t always correlate with high climate risks.
- Sectors like power generation can shift to renewable energy more easily than others, such as steel production, where alternatives are limited.
- Policy focus and sector-specific challenges must be considered alongside emissions data.

## 2. Net-Zero and Science-Based Targets (SBTi)
- Companies are adopting net-zero emission targets, but with significant variations:
  - Targets can be absolute or relative.
  - They may cover different emission scopes (Scope 1, 2, or 3) or rely on offsets.
- **Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)** standardizes and certifies corporate climate targets.
  - Over 5,000 companies are committed to SBTi; ~2,000 are verified (as of 2023).
  - Sector-specific methodologies have been developed, including for financial institutions.

## 3. Emission Trajectories and Temperature Alignment
- **Emission trajectories** assess if companies are on track to meet climate goals (e.g., net-zero by 2050).
- **Temperature alignment** quantifies how a company or portfolio aligns with global warming limits, but varying methodologies complicate comparisons.
  - Example: Japan’s GPIF estimates its portfolio is aligned with a 3°C warming trajectory.

## 4. Tools and Frameworks for Environmental Assessment
- Free-to-use tools include:
  - **WWF-CDP Temperature Rating Methodology** for financial institutions.
  - **PACTA (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment)** models emissions and temperature pathways for listed securities.
  - **ESG for Investors** offers a climate portfolio optimizer to model risk, return, and climate impact.

## 5. Green Capital Expenditures, Revenues, and R&D
- Evaluating companies’ green capex, revenue from low-carbon products, and R&D is key to understanding their transition.
- Examples:
  - **Carbon Tracker Initiative** assesses oil and gas capex decisions under climate scenarios.
  - Providers like **FTSE Russell** and **HSBC** track revenue from over 100 low-carbon products.

## 6. Natural Capital and Ecosystem Dependencies
- **Natural capital** assesses businesses' dependencies on ecosystems and biodiversity, helping them gauge risks and opportunities.
- Tools include:
  - **Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT)** for biodiversity risks.
  - **CERES Water Risk Filter** and **WWF Water Risk Filter** for water-related risks.

## 7. Climate Scenario Analysis
- **Climate scenario analysis** evaluates how companies or portfolios might perform under different climate futures.
- Recommended by the **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)**, focusing on resilience to 2°C scenarios.
- Investors use scenario analysis to assess both financial impacts and portfolio alignment with climate goals, although methodologies vary.
