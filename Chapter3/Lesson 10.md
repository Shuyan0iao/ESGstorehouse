# Key Megatrends and Drivers Influencing Environmental Change

## Life-Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions (2021)
- **Technologies discussed**: Power generation (gas, coal, nuclear, hydropower, solar PV, wind), heating (gas boilers, heat pumps), vehicles (ICE, EV), trucks (ICE, H₂), and hydrogen (SMR, electrolysis).
- **Key point**: Technical potential doesn’t guarantee deployment; it depends on economics, availability of alternatives, and social preferences.

## Hydrogen: Hope or Hype?
- **Use cases**: Hydrogen is a candidate for industrial, transport, and domestic applications.
- **Barriers to adoption**: Embrittling effect on steel, thermodynamic inefficiency.
- **Renewed interest**: UK, EU, and China have announced "hydrogen strategies" and funding commitments.
- **Cost trend**: Clean hydrogen prices have fallen below grey hydrogen prices in some regions due to rising gas costs and incentives like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act.

## Real Estate Standards and Sustainability
- **UK initiative**: The Better Buildings Partnership (BBP) aims for net-zero carbon by 2050.
- **Current challenges**: Existing energy efficiency standards are insufficient; initiatives like *Design for Performance* (based on NABERS) focus on operational performance.
- **Future outlook**: Governments are expected to adopt stronger standards for real estate energy efficiency.

## Investments in Low-Carbon Energy Transition
- **2021 global investment**: US$755 billion, with China leading.
- **Main areas of funding**: Renewable energy, electrified transport, and heating.
- **Corporate investment**: Companies are increasingly venturing into clean technology, supported by initiatives like EIT InnoEnergy and SEIF.

## Green Financial Products
- **Key products**: Green bonds, green loans, sustainability-linked loans, crowdfunding, and ETFs.
- **Green bond issuance**: Surpassed US$2.3 trillion by 2022.
- **Focus on transparency**: Preventing greenwashing through efforts like the EU’s work to harmonize standards for green financial products.

## Sustainable Financing and ESG Bonds
- **ESG-labeled bonds**: Link financing terms to environmental, social, or transition performance indicators.
- **Market decline in 2022**: Attributed to higher borrowing costs and skepticism around greenwashing.
- **Transparency requirements**: Green bonds must follow guidelines set by organizations like the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA) to ensure proper use of funds.

## Blue Economy and Sustainable Ocean Use
- **Definition**: The blue economy refers to the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth while preserving ocean ecosystems.
- **Ocean-based industries**: Include aquaculture, coastal tourism, maritime transport, offshore wind energy, desalination, and marine biotechnology.
- **Economic potential**: The ocean economy could more than double its contribution to global value added, exceeding US$3 trillion, by 2030.
- **Blue Economy Development Framework (BEDF)**: Launched by the World Bank and European Commission to help coastal states transition to sustainable blue economies.
