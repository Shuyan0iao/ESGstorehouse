*Definition of Natural Resources*: Natural resources include freshwater, biodiversity, land use, forestry, and marine resources, as well as non-renewable resources like fossil fuels, minerals, and metals.

Natural Capital: Natural capital refers to the world's stock of natural assets that provide ecosystem services essential for human life, valued between $125 trillion and $140 trillion annually, highlighting its intrinsic and economic value.

Drivers of Resource Pressure:

Population Growth: The world population is projected to increase significantly, raising demand for food and resources.
Economic Growth: Increased consumption, particularly in affluent middle classes, intensifies resource strain.
Technological Innovation: Innovations and the shift to a circular economy can mitigate resource depletion but require efficiency improvements.
Depletion of Resources:

The demand for phosphorus, crucial for agriculture, is set to rise while reserves may deplete within 50-100 years, creating food security challenges.
Half of the world's vegetated land is already used for agriculture, complicating efforts to combat climate change without further deforestation.
Economic Trends:

There is a growing trend of decoupling economic growth from resource usage, with examples of increased GDP alongside reduced carbon emissions.
The Jevons paradox illustrates that efficiency gains may lead to higher overall consumption, necessitating systemic changes to reduce resource strain.
Water Scarcity:

Although 70% of the Earth is water, only 2.5% is freshwater, essential for various sectors. Water demand is expected to rise across all sectors.
Over 2 billion people face high water stress, and 4 billion experience severe scarcity at least once a year, posing significant global risks.
The UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goal 6 emphasizes the need for sustainable water management by 2030.
Policy Implications: Investors and policymakers must navigate trade-offs between resource efficiency and overall consumption while considering the value of natural capital in economic assessments.
