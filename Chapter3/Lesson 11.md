# Environmental Factors: Key Facts

## Key Environmental Factors Impacting Investments
- **Climate change**: Accelerating due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, posing risks to human health, economies, and ecosystems.
- **Natural resources**: Water, biodiversity, land use, forestry, and marine resources are critical.
- **Pollution and waste**: Linked to challenges in the circular economy, where efficient use of raw materials, recycling, and waste management are key.

## Climate Change and Mitigation
- **Paris Agreement (2015)**: Aims to keep global temperature rise below 2°C (3.6°F) and ideally limit it to 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels.
- **Net-zero targets**: By 2050, covering 80% of global emissions, 90% of GDP, and a majority of the world’s population.
- **Carbon pricing**: Seen as an effective tool for reducing emissions, though current pricing levels remain low.

## Risks of Climate Change
- **Physical risks**: Linked to climate inaction, including the degradation of ecosystems and impacts on businesses.
- **Transition risks**: Associated with the costs of transitioning to low-carbon economies.
- **Environmental degradation**: Includes water scarcity, deforestation, unsustainable agriculture, and pollution, all affecting business and investments.

## Circular Economy
- **Focus**: Efficient use of resources, recycling, and waste reduction to alleviate environmental pressures.

## Integration of Environmental Risks in Investments
- **Material issues**: Environmental factors affecting business models, operating expenses, revenue, margins, and risks.
- **Financial tools**: Various risk analysis tools like carbon footprinting and climate scenario analysis help investors integrate environmental risks into decision-making.
- **Economic benefits**: Solutions such as renewable energy (wind and solar) offer cost savings and higher returns compared to inefficient, fossil-fuel-based technologies.

## Policy and Regulatory Trends
- **Climate-related disclosures**: Increasing across the investment chain, from capital owners (e.g., pension funds) to investee companies.
- **Technological innovation**: Promoting investment opportunities in clean energy, mobility, sustainable buildings, and advanced materials.

## Investment Products
- **Sustainability-linked products**: Growing focus on low-carbon funds and debt aiming to capture opportunities in climate and environmental solutions.
