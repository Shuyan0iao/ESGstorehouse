# Systemic Relationships between Business Activities and Environmental Issues

### Importance of Sustainability Reporting
- Companies are increasingly held accountable for their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impacts.
- Investors demand transparency regarding companies' sustainability practices, leading to a growing focus on non-financial disclosures.
- The concept of “double materiality” requires companies to report both the impact of climate change on their operations and their operations' impact on the environment.

### Frameworks and Guidelines
- The UK and EU have established guidelines to standardize ESG reporting, emphasizing the need for companies to disclose relevant data.
- Tools such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) provide frameworks for organizations to report climate-related risks.

### Industry Challenges
- Industries face challenges related to managing ESG risks, with many lacking comprehensive sustainability strategies.
- Stakeholders increasingly expect companies to demonstrate their commitment to sustainable practices through measurable actions and transparent reporting.

## Case Study: Consumer Goods Sector
- The consumer goods sector has been a focal point for sustainability efforts, as it encompasses various environmental impacts, from raw material sourcing to end-of-life disposal.
- Companies in this sector face pressure from both consumers and investors to adopt more sustainable practices and reduce their environmental footprints.

## Supply Chain Management
- Companies need to understand and manage the environmental impacts throughout their supply chains.
- Supply chain transparency is critical for identifying risks related to labor practices, environmental impact, and product safety.

## Resource Efficiency
- Improving resource efficiency is essential for reducing operational costs and environmental impact.
- Companies can adopt circular economy principles to minimize waste and enhance sustainability.

### Technological Innovations
- Technology plays a crucial role in enhancing supply chain transparency and efficiency.
- Companies are leveraging innovations such as blockchain and AI to improve traceability and manage resources more effectively.

## Environmental Impact Measurement and Management
  - Companies must measure, manage, and disclose both the positive and negative environmental impacts of their operations.
  - Key impacts include toxic waste generation, water pollution, loss of biodiversity, deforestation, high greenhouse gas emissions, and significant energy consumption.
  - Addressing environmental challenges can mitigate risks and create opportunities for climate-resilient strategies.

- **Regulatory Developments**
  - The UK government updated environmental reporting guidelines in March 2019, emphasizing environmental KPIs that link performance to financial outcomes.
  - The European Commission introduced a Circular Economy Action Plan and guidelines under the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, promoting the concept of "double materiality."

## Case Study: Global Mining and Metals Sector
- The sector has significant environmental impacts, highlighted by Vale's 2019 dam disaster in Brazil, resulting in over 250 deaths and substantial financial losses.
- Investor scrutiny increased following the disaster, with a coalition demanding transparency about the safety of tailings dams.
- Major mining companies often receive low sustainability ratings, emphasizing the need for improved operational and supply chain management.

## Supply Chain Transparency and Traceability
- Supply chain sustainability involves managing ESG impacts beyond factory operations, focusing on raw material sourcing.
- Investors expect companies to disclose their exposure to supply chain ESG risks to avoid reputational and financial risks.
- High emissions from supply chains (Scope 3) require understanding and management, particularly in fossil fuels and food systems.

## Environmental Risks in Supply Chains
- Key environmental risks include material toxicity, GHG emissions, energy and water use, air pollution, biodiversity, and deforestation.
- Forest-risk commodities (e.g., beef, palm oil, soy) drive deforestation, with significant investments linked to these risks.
- The UK government may impose fines on companies failing to prove their supply chains are free from illegal deforestation, leading to increased investor engagement.

## Measurement Frameworks and Tools
- Organizations provide frameworks and tools to trace sustainability issues in supply chains, such as:
  - **The Sustainability Consortium**: Performance indicators for consumer products.
  - **WWF**: Risk indicators for various commodities.
  - **CDP and Global Reporting Initiative**: Standards for comparing sustainability impacts.
  - **SASB**: Standards for public companies to report on sustainability.
  - **EU Taxonomy**: Metrics to assess compliance with the Paris Agreement.
  - **Trase and ENCORE tools**: Initiatives for environmental impact assessment.

- Multi-stakeholder initiatives enhance traceability in complex supply chains, including:
  - **Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)**
  - **Marine Stewardship Council**
  - **Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)**
  - **Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International**
