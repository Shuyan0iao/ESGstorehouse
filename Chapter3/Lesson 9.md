# Nature Assessment and TNFD Framework

## Learning Outcome
- **Objective**: Understand methodologies related to biodiversity, valuation, risk management, and the interconnectedness of environmental factors and nature-related risks.

## Key Points

### Human Dependence on Nature
- **World Economic Forum (2020)**: 50% of global GDP is dependent on nature, yet we rely 100% on nature for essentials (water, food, air, etc.).
- **WWF (2022)**: Wildlife populations have declined 69% since 1970 due to practices like monoculture farming, deforestation, and soil degradation.
- **Planetary Boundaries**: Six of nine boundaries have been crossed, including biodiversity loss and land system change.

### Decline in Natural Capital
- **Dasgupta Review**: The use of resources has led to a 40% decline in natural capital per person between 1992-2014. 
- **Deforestation**: Amplifies biodiversity loss, water stress, carbon sequestration issues, and increases zoonotic diseases and food insecurity.

### Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF)
- **Goal by 2030**: Conserve 30% of global lands, waters, and oceans for biodiversity and ecosystem services (December 2022 commitment).

### Financial and Policy Responses
- **World Bank (2020)**: Biodiversity loss is now seen as a systemic risk alongside climate change by central banks.
- **Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosure (TNFD)**: Established in 2021 to develop a framework for assessing nature-related risks and opportunities.

### TNFD Framework and Integration
- **Nature Definition (IPBES)**: Emphasizes biodiversity and ecosystem services' role in providing benefits (e.g., crop yields, pollination, water quality).
- **TNFD Realms**: Focus on land, freshwater, oceans, and atmosphere. Climate and nature are interconnected, impacting business and societal outcomes.

### Financial Risk Transmission
- **Ecosystem Services Dependency**: Businesses like beverage companies depend on natural services (e.g., water purification) for operations.
- **Opportunities**: Actions such as afforestation and pollution control can reduce risks and create positive environmental outcomes.

### Drivers of Nature Change
- Five drivers include: climate change, land/sea use changes, resource exploitation, pollution, and invasive species.

### Aviva Case Study on Deforestation Risk
- **Corporate Investments**: 38% of Aviva's corporate holdings exposed to deforestation risk are weak in managing it.
- **Sovereign Investments**: Minimal exposure to deforestation through sovereign debt.
- **Real Assets**: Low exposure to commodity-driven deforestation in Europe.

### TNFD LEAP Assessment Framework
- **LEAP**: Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare â€“ helps businesses understand nature-related dependencies, risks, and opportunities.
