## Definition of Natural Resources
- **Natural Resources**: Include freshwater, biodiversity, land use, forestry, and marine resources, along with non-renewable resources like fossil fuels, minerals, and metals.

---

## Natural Capital
- **Natural Capital**: Refers to the world's stock of natural assets providing ecosystem services essential for human life, valued between $125 trillion and $140 trillion annually, indicating both intrinsic and economic value.

---

## Drivers of Resource Pressure
- **Population Growth**: Significant projected increase in global population, raising demand for food and resources.
- **Economic Growth**: Increased consumption in affluent middle classes intensifies strain on resources.
- **Technological Innovation**: Innovations and shifts to a circular economy can mitigate resource depletion, necessitating efficiency improvements.

---

## Depletion of Resources
- **Phosphorus Demand**: Rising demand for phosphorus (crucial for agriculture) may lead to depletion of reserves within 50-100 years, creating food security challenges.
- **Agricultural Land Use**: Half of the worldâ€™s vegetated land is used for agriculture, complicating climate change mitigation without further deforestation.

---

## Economic Trends
- **Decoupling Growth**: Trend of decoupling economic growth from resource usage; examples include increased GDP alongside reduced carbon emissions.
- **Jevons Paradox**: Efficiency gains may lead to higher overall consumption, highlighting the need for systemic changes to reduce resource strain.

---

## Water Scarcity
- **Freshwater Availability**: Despite 70% of Earth being water, only 2.5% is freshwater, critical for various sectors; water demand is projected to rise.
- **Global Water Stress**: Over 2 billion people face high water stress, and 4 billion experience severe scarcity at least once a year, posing significant risks.
- **Sustainable Development Goal 6**: Emphasizes the need for sustainable water management by 2030.

---


## Policy Implications
- **Resource Efficiency vs. Consumption**: Investors and policymakers must balance trade-offs between improving resource efficiency and managing overall consumption, while valuing natural capital in economic assessments.

---

## Biodiversity
- **Definition and Importance**: Refers to the variability among living organisms, vital for ecosystem services that support human health, well-being, and economic growth.
- **Climate Resilience**: Critical for climate-resilient development; conserving 30% to 50% of Earth's land, freshwater, and ocean areas is essential.
- **Ecosystem Services**: Biodiversity supports services like food, clean water, genetic resources, flood protection, nutrient cycling, and climate regulation.
- **Economic Impact**: Inaction on biodiversity loss could incur costs of $10 trillion by 2050, affecting agriculture and fisheries.
- **Conservation Strategies**: Effective conservation can reduce extinction risks; precautionary approaches are needed due to uncertainties about biodiversity thresholds.
- **Health Connections**: Land use changes and biodiversity loss can lead to infectious diseases, linking conservation to human health.

---

## Land Use and Forestry
- **Impact on Resources**: Land use practices affect natural resources such as water, soil, and biodiversity; forests are key to carbon cycling and climate mitigation.
- **Deforestation Rates**: Accelerating deforestation, mainly driven by agriculture, results in substantial CO2 emissions.
- **Financial Risks**: Companies tied to deforestation face supply disruptions, cost volatility, and reputational damage; sustainable land management supports economic development.
- **Sustainable Agriculture**: Conventional practices contribute to biodiversity loss and threaten food security amidst climate change.

---

## Marine Resources
- **Ocean's Role**: Oceans are crucial for carbon storage and contribute approximately $1.3 trillion to the global economy.
- **Overfishing Concerns**: Unsustainable fishing has led to a decline in fish stocks, with many marine fisheries being overexploited.
- **Blue Economy**: Sustainable use of ocean resources presents opportunities for economic growth while preserving marine ecosystems.

---

## Pollution and Waste
- **Air Pollution**: Significant health risks, causing millions of premature deaths and impacting ecosystems.
- **Water Pollution**: Poses serious threats to organisms, driven by industrial discharge and plastic waste.
- **Waste Management**: Increasing consumption and waste generation pressure waste systems, prompting a shift towards circular economy models.

---

## Circular Economy
- **Definition and Principles**: Aims to minimize waste and extend resource lifecycles through eliminating waste, keeping materials in use, and regenerating natural systems.
- **Economic Opportunities**: Circular economy strategies can reduce emissions and promote sustainable economic growth, with potential across various industries.
- **Global Initiatives**: Growing international commitment to addressing waste and promoting sustainable resource management, especially regarding plastic pollution.
