---

### Key Points

#### Materiality or Risk Assessment
- **Impact of Social Factors:** Assess how social trends affect companies across various sectors and regions, especially in industries prone to human rights violations (e.g., mining, oil & gas).
- **Integration in Risk Assessment:** Non-financial risks, including social factors, can significantly influence investment performance and should be incorporated into traditional risk assessments.
- **Investment Opportunities:** Companies that adapt to social trends may provide unique investment opportunities.
- **Double Materiality Reporting:** Emerging regulations in the EU and UK mandate that companies report both on sustainability matters that influence business value and their impact on society and the environment.

#### Case Studies

1. **Amazon:**
   - **Labor Practices:** Criticism over poor working conditions and low wages. Reports of high employee turnover and mental health crises linked to surveillance and harsh conditions.
   - **Financial Implications:** While lower wages may enhance short-term profits, risks from social unrest or regulation can disrupt operations and incur costs.

2. **Apple/Foxconn/Inventec:**
   - **Labor Violations:** Past controversies regarding excessive working hours and poor conditions led to investigations and public scrutiny.
   - **Impact on Brand:** Incidents affected stock prices and customer loyalty, emphasizing the need for social responsibility in supply chains.

3. **Thai Union:**
   - **Human Rights Concerns:** Faced accusations of human rights abuses and environmental damage, leading to boycotts and financial losses.
   - **Response to Criticism:** Implemented new codes of conduct and made commitments to improve labor practices, which could enhance brand reputation and mitigate risks.

#### Quality of Management
- **Assessment of Management:** Evaluate how companies manage social risks and opportunities, including corporate strategies and performance indicators. Poor management may indicate broader stakeholder management issues.

#### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)
- **Importance of DEI:** Strong DEI practices correlate with better decision-making and investment outcomes. The CFA Institute emphasizes DEI's role in enhancing investment strategies.

#### Ratio Analysis and Financial Modeling
- **Quantifying Social Factors:** Incorporate potential social factor impacts into financial models and ratio analyses, such as costs from labor disputes, turnover, and regulatory fines.
- **Impact of Poor Management:** High-risk profiles may lead analysts to adjust discount rates when assessing companies that fail to manage social issues adequately.

#### Case Study: Tesco Equal Pay Claim
- **Equal Pay Dispute:** Tesco faces a significant claim regarding unequal pay between distribution center and shop floor workers, predominantly affecting female staff.
- **Financial Risks:** The outcome could have major financial implications for Tesco and the retail sector, highlighting the importance of compliance with labor rights.
