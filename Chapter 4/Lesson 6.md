## Application of Social Factors in Investments

### 1. Materiality or Risk Assessment
- **Financial Materiality**: Assessing social factors like human rights and health/safety in high-risk sectors (e.g., mining, oil and gas) helps determine potential impacts on investee companies.
- **Double Materiality**: Recent EU/UK regulations require companies to report on both financial materiality (business value) and impact materiality (effect on society and environment).
  - **Negative Impact Assessments**: OECD and UN Guiding Principles.
  - **Positive Impact and Value Creation**: Referencing UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
  
#### Case Study: Amazon, Apple, and Thai Union
- **Amazon**: Criticized for poor working conditions, aggressive monitoring, and inadequate wages. While these practices might cut costs, they risk employee turnover, social unrest, or regulatory penalties.
- **Apple**: Faced scrutiny over suppliers’ labor practices (Foxconn, Inventec), including long hours, low wages, and workplace suicides. Such issues affect customer loyalty and stock performance.
- **Thai Union**: Accused of labor abuses in 2015, leading to revenue loss, terminated supplier contracts, and increased oversight. Collaboration with Greenpeace and implementation of ethical practices strengthened brand image.

### 2. Quality of Management
- **Assessment**: Evaluating management’s handling of social factors includes reviewing strategy, policies, and performance indicators, relative to industry standards and competitors.
- **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)**: DEI promotes better decision-making and investment outcomes. CFA Institute’s 2022 DEI Code emphasizes the role of diversity in corporate performance.

### 3. Ratio Analysis and Financial Modeling
- **Incorporating Social Factors**: Analysts should model scenarios to quantify social risks, potentially adjusting financial projections and discount rates to reflect elevated risk from:
  - Occupational health issues (fines, liabilities),
  - High employee turnover (training costs),
  - Supply chain problems (brand damage),
  - Local protests disrupting business operations, and
  - Product safety concerns due to poor working conditions.

#### Case Study: Tesco Equal Pay Claim
- **Background**: Tesco faces a £4 billion equal pay claim, with predominantly female shop floor employees earning less than male distribution staff for work of comparable value, potentially breaching the Equality Act 2010.
- **Financial Materiality**: This case could have significant financial and reputational repercussions for Tesco and other UK retailers, as it addresses core labor rights.
