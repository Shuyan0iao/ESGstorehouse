# Key Social Issues and Business Activities

## Implementation of Social Factors in Investment Decisions
1. **Identify Controversial Factors:** Determine which social factors are most controversial or financially material in each industry.
   
2. **Assess Company Exposure:** Evaluate how exposed specific companies are to sector-specific social factors and their management of these risks based on business models and geographic operations.
   
3. **Evaluate Supply Chain:** Where relevant, assess critical social factors in the supply chain.

### Financial Materiality
- Social elements deemed financially material vary by industry and depend on specific aspects related to that field.
- The **Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)** framework provides guidance on financially material topics within industries.
