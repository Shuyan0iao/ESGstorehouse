## Identifying Material Social Factors for Investors

### 1. Material Impacts of Social Issues on Investments
- **Scope of Social Factors**: Investors should consider a broad range of social issues that impact investments, such as demographics, digitization, rights and responsibilities, family dynamics, education and employment, faith-based investing, inequality, and globalization.
- **Avoiding Oversight**: Overlooking these social factors can lead to risks in portfolio performance, with specific factors affecting different countries, sectors, and companies uniquely.

### 2. Approaches to Social Analysis
- **Context Matters**: Social factorsâ€™ impacts vary by geography, industry, and company. Understanding this materiality begins at a broad, country-level and narrows down to the sector and specific company context.
- **Country-Level Considerations**: Regional context is crucial, considering economic development, regulatory frameworks (like labor laws), and cultural factors. Examples:
  - **Aging Populations**: A concern in developed regions, less so in emerging markets.
  - **Rural vs. Urban Issues**: More pronounced in emerging markets.

### 3. Regulatory Frameworks and Case Studies
- **EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities**:
  - This taxonomy sets thresholds for activities contributing to six environmental goals (e.g., climate change mitigation, biodiversity).
  - For alignment, activities must not harm other objectives and must comply with global standards like OECD guidelines and ILO conventions.
- **UK Modern Slavery Act**:
  - Requires companies to disclose anti-slavery measures in supply chains, allowing investors to evaluate social responsibility.
- **Regulatory Trends**: Social data disclosure pressures are increasing globally, with influential bodies like the Human Capital Management Coalition in the U.S. advocating for human capital transparency, and IOSCO promoting standardized global frameworks.

### 4. Sector-Specific Social Trends
- **Industry Risks**: Different sectors face unique social risks:
  - **Supply Chain Risks**: For example, child labor in apparel (cotton) or environmental concerns in mining.
  - **Impact of Technology**: Automation affects transport (self-driving cars) more significantly than vehicle servicing.
  - **Demographics and Healthcare**: Aging populations influence demand and workforce availability in healthcare.
  - **Tech Solutions**: Innovations like satellite imagery aid in identifying sector-specific injustices (e.g., illegal deforestation in forestry).

### 5. Company-Level Variability
- **Influence of Company Culture and Operations**: Social factors impact companies differently within a sector based on governance, operational systems, and adaptability.
- **Risks and Expectations**: Key social issues can:
  - Affect profitability;
  - Impact workforce and supply chain dynamics;
  - Shape corporate responsibility (e.g., human rights) and consumer expectations (e.g., animal welfare).
