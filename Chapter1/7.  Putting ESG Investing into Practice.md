# Putting ESG Investing into Practice

Three ways in which investors typically reflect ESG considerations in their investment process.
1. **Incorporating ESG factors into investment decision-making**
2. **Corporate engagement**
3. **Policy engagement**

Different institutions adopt varied approaches, blending these elements according to their culture and investment style.

## 1. Investment Decisions
Incorporating ESG factors into investment decision-making occurs throughout the investment value chain:

- **Asset Owners**:
  - Include ESG factors in requests for proposals (RFPs) and consider them during the appointment process.
  - Work with investment consultants who evaluate asset managers based on their ESG policies, implementation, and outcomes.
  - Integrate ESG considerations into investment mandates and monitoring processes to ensure alignment with their views on ESG issues.

- **Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA)**:
  - Asset owners and some managers can embed ESG factors into SAA, determining capital allocation across asset classes, sectors, and regions based on return needs, income requirements, and risk appetite.

- **Security Selection and Portfolio Management**:
  - Asset managers and direct investors can incorporate ESG issues by:
    - Using ratings to filter potential investments.
    - Integrating ESG issues into financial and risk analyses.
    - Applying ESG criteria to identify thematic investment opportunities (e.g., water funds, impact investing).

## 2. Shareholder Engagement
Investors can promote better ESG practices among investees through:

- **Annual General Meetings (AGMs)**: Formally expressing views by voting on resolutions.
- **Direct Engagement**: Discussing ESG issues with the board or management of investee companies, either individually or through collective initiatives.

## 3. Policy Engagement
Institutional investors' ability to generate sustainable returns is influenced by public policy. Therefore, policy engagement is a key extension of investors' responsibilities and fiduciary duties. This includes:

- Collaborating with regulators, standard setters, and other stakeholders (e.g., consultants, stock exchanges) to create a more stable and equitable financial system that incorporates ESG factors into decision-making.
- Engaging in policy consultations, participating in collective initiatives, and making recommendations to policymakers.
