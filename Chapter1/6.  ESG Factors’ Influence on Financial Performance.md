# ESG Factors' Influence on Financial Performance

## 1. Positive Correlation with Financial Performance
- A review of over 2,000 studies found a strong positive link between ESG factors and corporate financial performance, with around 90% showing either positive or neutral results.
- Engaging companies on ESG issues tends to improve their risk management and operational practices, benefitting both the companies and investors.

## 2. Meta-Analysis Findings on ESG and Corporate Performance
- **Deutsche Bank (2012)**: Among 100+ studies, 89% showed ESG-strong companies outperforming the market over the medium to long term, although translating this into fund performance proved challenging.
- **University of Oxford and Arabesque (2014)**: Analysis of 200 studies found:
  - 90% concluded ESG standards lower capital costs.
  - 88% showed ESG practices enhance operational performance.
  - 80% correlated ESG with improved stock price performance.
- **Friede, Busch, and Bassen (2015)**: A comprehensive review of 2,200 studies found:
  - Positive or neutral ESG impacts on financial performance in 90% of cases.
  - Positive correlations across equity, fixed income, and property asset classes.
  - Mixed results for portfolio-level impact: 15% positive, 11% negative, due to challenges in capturing alpha and implementation costs.

## 3. Latest Research from NYU Stern and Rockefeller Asset Management (2021)
- Analyzed 1,000 studies (2015â€“2020) and found:
  - **Corporate Studies**: 58% reported positive results on financial metrics like ROE, ROA, and stock price; 13% were neutral, 21% mixed, and 8% negative.
  - **Investment Studies**: 59% showed similar or better performance than traditional investments; 14% showed negative results.
- Climate change-focused studies (59 total) found:
  - **Corporate Impact**: 57% positive, 29% neutral, 9% mixed, and 6% negative.
  - **Investor Impact**: 65% positive or neutral compared to conventional investments, with only 13% negative findings.

## 4. Reasons for Variability in Fund-Level Performance
- **Alpha Capture Issues**: ESG alpha may be obscured by other factors in broader studies.
- **Diverse ESG Approaches**: Variability across studies may dilute results.
- **Implementation Costs**: Costs associated with ESG integration can reduce alpha gains.

## Conclusion
Evidence suggests ESG factors positively impact corporate financial performance, though translating these gains consistently to fund performance remains challenging due to alpha capture, varied ESG approaches, and implementation costs.
