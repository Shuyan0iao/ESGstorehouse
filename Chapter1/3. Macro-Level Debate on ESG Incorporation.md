# Macro-Level Debate on ESG Incorporation

## 1. Purpose and Value of ESG Integration
ESG integration serves financial and societal goals, addressing risk, fiduciary duty, economic impact, client demand, and regulatory requirements.

## 2. Risk Perspective
Climate and environmental risks are increasingly critical. Influential leaders like Mark Carney and Larry Fink support ESG for financial stability, advocating for climate-related disclosures and transition plans.

## 3. Fiduciary Duty
Fiduciary responsibility now includes ESG as essential for long-term performance. Studies by UNEP FI and PRI emphasize ESGâ€™s role in fulfilling fiduciary obligations.

## 4. Economic Perspective
ESG factors contribute to long-term economic stability. Frameworks like the "planetary boundaries" and "doughnut economics" highlight the need for sustainable investments to avoid ecological and economic disruption.

## 5. Impact and Ethics
Ethical considerations drive some investors toward positive impact (impact investing) and away from harmful industries (negative screening), aligning investments with societal values.

## 6. Client Demand
Growing client demand for transparency in ESG factors drives asset owners to integrate ESG and pursue net-zero commitments.

## 7. Regulatory Pressure
Since 2008, regulations on ESG integration have increased globally, encouraging or mandating the consideration of ESG factors in investment decision-making.
